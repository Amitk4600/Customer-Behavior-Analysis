Python and SQL are used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, while Power BI is used to build an interactive and visually rich dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze customer purchase patterns
* Identify high-revenue customer segments
* Evaluate product-wise performance
* Study the effect of subscriptions on revenue
* Provide actionable business insights

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis
* **SQL** – Querying and aggregating customer data
* **Power BI** – Data modeling and interactive dashboard creation
* **Excel / CSV** – Data source

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes customer purchase-related attributes such as:

* Gender
* Age Group
* Item Purchased
* Purchase Amount / Revenue
